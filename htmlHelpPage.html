            <h4>Manually Install Project</h4>
            <p>Clone the repository onto the your local machine and start your web server, whether it be WAMP or MAMP.
                Create a new databse in your database software of choice e.g. MongoDB or MySQL phpmyadmin, name the
                database "eventee" then import the SQL file that contains all teh database tables and data.</p>

            <h4>Navigating the Application</h4>
            <p>There are 10 key functions within the app:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Register - The unregistered user will be able to input their details in the form that will show

                    and login</li>
                <li> Is Logged In - because of how this application is expected to be utilized the application can be
                    utilized by both logged in and non-logged in users, although a few functions are limited to users
                    who are logged in.</li>

            <br>
            <h4>API Testing</h4>
            <p>In the root of the project directory there is a folder called "debug" which contains the script file that
                contains the necessary test scripts for all the API calls</p>
            <h4>Information about the Backend</h4>
            <h5>API</h5>
            <p>For this application, I utilized the base case system to make the principle API of the system. This
                document is the ws.php record and is situated in the SRC organizer of the application information. This
                document contains the principle capacities for the activities of the application and is used by both the
                backend and the frontend of the interface to make usefulness. There are two valuable recorded to the
                ws.php document which is the db.php and the sessions.php documents the two of which are essential for
                usefulness. The DB document contains all the SQL demands that really cooperate with and adjust the
                database for the application.</p>
            <p>
                Talend custom test script:
                The Talend API tester was used to create the testing script for the app. The test functions and the
                expected response codes are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Register (POST): 202 Success</li>
                <li>Login (POST): 202 Success</li>
                <li>is_logged_in? (GET): 202 Success</li>
                <li>logout (GET): 202 Success</li>
                <li>Create Events (POST): 202 Success</li>
                <li>Display Events (GET): 202 Success</li>
                <li>Fill Events Update (GET): 202 Success</li>
                <li>Update Events (POST): 202 Success</li>
                <li>Delete Events (POST): 202 Success</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Security</h5>
            <p>All clients on the framework that are enlisted clients use PHP encryption to hash the passwords in the
                information base and guarantee their security.
                The administrator panel is ensured utilizing a type of IP whitelisting that will hide all open fields
                from show and will send the user back to the front finish of the application if their IP doesn't
                coordinate the IP coded into the framework.
                If a user breaks through to the backend by utilizing a similar IP, they will be stopped from getting to
                the backend if they don't have the consent of the "administrator" alloted to the account within the
                database.</p>
            <h4>Validation in Forms</h5>
                <p>The form validation on the administrator panel is provided by the React Form Validation feature
                    built-in. It utilized the set state function to test whether data sources meet the set regex rules
                    and in the event that it doesn't the code won't run, and a blunder will show up.</p>
